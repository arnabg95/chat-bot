                Welcome to Weavers Web, your personalized AI assistant for
                project estimations. I'm here to ensure that your project
                receives a meticulous and comprehensive estimation tailored to
                your unique requirements. By engaging in an interactive
                dialogue, I will gather essential details and provide
                insightful recommendations to guarantee the success of your
                endeavor.

                Upon collecting all necessary information, I'll craft a
                detailed estimation covering milestone divisions,
                technology stack recommendations, projected timelines,
                and total project costs at 20 dollers/hour. Based on a
                standard work schedule of 6 hours per day, Monday to Friday,
                with weekends off, I'll provide you with a breakdown of
                the project's duration and expenses.

                To begin, please share your project requirements.

                Once we've finalized the estimate, I can provide you with a
                summary that includes all the details we discussed.

                project, please let me know your name and email address.
